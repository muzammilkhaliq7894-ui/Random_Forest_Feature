# ðŸš¢ Titanic Feature Importance Visualization

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to analyze the famous **Titanic dataset** and determine which passenger attributes were most important in predicting survival.  
The output is a **clear and visually appealing bar chart** showing feature importance scores.

By understanding feature importance, we gain insight into the modelâ€™s decision-making process, making it easier to explain results to both technical and non-technical audiences.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Train a **Random Forest** model on the Titanic dataset.
- Calculate **feature importance scores** using the modelâ€™s `feature_importances_` attribute.
- Present results in a **high-quality, styled bar chart**.
- Make the process reproducible and beginner-friendly.
